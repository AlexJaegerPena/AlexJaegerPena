I’m a motivated mobile app developer who loves turning ideas into real apps.

Before I started coding, I was already curious about how technology works.
I liked exploring things, learning by doing, and creating something from nothing.
That natural curiosity and technical mindset eventually set me on the path I’m on today.

After a few detours and explorations, I found my sweet spot: mobile-first software development.
Right now, I’m sharpening my skills at Syntax Institut (2024–2025), building full-stack mobile apps for Android (Kotlin & Jetpack Compose) and iOS (SwiftUI).

I enjoy creating apps that feel smooth, intuitive, and visually clean. Apps that people enjoy using.
